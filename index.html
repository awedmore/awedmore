        <strong>Technical Product Manager with a passion for solving 
        complex problems using a data-driven approach. </strong> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Originally a software developer using a BPM software called Appian, I used the communication, client 
        relationship, and technical skills I had developed to transition into Product Management.
           Now, I utilize my technical background and strong communication
        skills to easily and efficiently collaborate with cross-functional teams by bridging the gap between technical and non-technical
        stakeholders. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have a breadth of experience working with full-stack products, including customer facing products, internal platforms and applications,
        and backend data processing. I excel at quickly learning new products, processes, and technology, and my experiences
        enable me to bring fresh perspective and innovation when transitioning onto a new team. 
        
        <br>
        <br>
         I still enjoy growing my technical skills and strive to have a conversant understanding 
         of the tech used to build the products I work with. At Capital One, I taught myself how to use tools like Databricks, Snowflake, 
         and Google Data Studio so that I could pull my own data and create interactive visuals to draw
         insights on product usage. Most recently, I built this website to enhance my understanding of HTML, CSS, and AWS. 
         <br>

        <div class='product-history'>
          <h3>In-Branch Teller Interactions</h3>
          <div>
            <p> Built full-stack web application with hardware integrations for in-person Teller-Customer interaction while maintaining
                the existing system for complete continuity of services. Re-imagined the customer experience and 
            worked closely with branch tellers to understand pain points in transaction processing. Created 
        KPIs for user interaction and backend performance, and monitored new releases using Splunk
    and New Relic.   </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='product-history'>
            <h3>Transaction Processing</h3>
            <div>
              <p> Replaced 7 SOAP APIs used for transaction processing with 4 modernized RESTful APIs. 
                  Coordinated 3 deveopment teams and Frontline Operations, Risk, Finance, and Settlement teams 
                  to build, test, and release the changes in 5 months. The new APIs improved transaction processing 
                  time by 25%. 
              </p>

            <h3>Mobile-First Cash Withdrawals</h3>
            <div>
              <p> Managed the development of both iOS and Android versions of a new 
                  mobile centric cash withdrawal experience. Created the pilot release plan to a small 
                  test population, coordinated closely with enterprise level platform teams to integrate 
                  feature into the main codebase, and performed rigorous testing to ensure desired performance.

            <h3>ATM Data Analysis and Reporting</h3>
            <div>
              <p> Modernized and enhanced internal data collection from and reporting on ATM fleet health. Implemented daily reports
                  sent via email and Slack to Operations and Frontline stakeholders, alerting of 
                  current or potential issues with ATM hardware. The new reporting reduced time to detect issues by 2 days. 
                  The enhanced data collection removed dependencies on external teams to collect and send ATM logs,
                  greatly decreasing the time and effort needed to troubleshoot both hardware and software issues in the fleet.
